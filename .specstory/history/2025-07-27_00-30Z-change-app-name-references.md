_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to change all references to the app name from "LlamaFast" to "LLMind" throughout the codebase. This is a global find-and-replace operation across multiple files. Let me think about where this name might appear:

1. File names and directory names
2. Code comments
3. Configuration files
4. README files
5. Documentation
6. HTML templates
7. JavaScript files
8. Python files
9. Shell scripts
10. The workspace file

This is a multi-step task, so I should create a todo list to track my progress. Let me first search for all occurrences of "LlamaFast" to get a complete picture of what needs to be changed.

I should use parallel searches to find all references efficiently:
- Search for "LlamaFast" in all files
- Look for any case variations like "llamafast", "LLAMAFAST"
- Check for file/directory names that contain "LlamaFast"</details></think>

I'll help you rename the app from LlamaFast to LLMind across the entire codebase. Let me first search for all occurrences of "LlamaFast" to understand the scope of changes needed.

- [-] Search for all references to 'LlamaFast' in the codebase
